# PICO-8 Porfolio

## Description
Welcome!

This is mi repository where I upload every [Pico-8](https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php) game I made, originally there was one repository for every game I made but since all my Pico-8 games are very small I thought that a single repostory for all of them was actually better in terms of organisation.

If you want to access a game page you can just search for it in the branch section of this repostory or click in the titles of the games down here, if you want to play the games you have a link to te itch.io page of every game in the README of the game's branch, or if you prefer you can see them all at [my itch.io page](https://justantors.itch.io/)

## Games

1. [Pong](https://github.com/JustAntoRS/Pico8_Projects/tree/Pong) a simple classic pong game with a local multiplayer mode and a single player mode
2. [The Cloud Business](https://github.com/JustAntoRS/Pico8_Projects/tree/CloudGame) a memory game about colors and plants
